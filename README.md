In this repository, it is possible to find the following documents containing the code to simulate the TSL structure in Ansys APDL:

Triangle lifter APDL - kassow: 
main document where the convergence analysis has been carried out and used as a starting point for the other documents.

Triangle lifter APDL - kassow iter orientation: 
used to compute the trend of stress and displacement depending on the orientation of the Kassow arm.

Triangle lifter APDL - kassow iter height: 
used to compute the trend of stress and displacement depending on the height of the platform.

Triangle lifter APDL - beam front test: 
used to simulate the test made with the beam in the front position.

Triangle lifter APDL - beam lateral test: 
used to simulate the test made with the beam in the lateral position.

Triangle lifter APDL - kassow 360 test: 
used to simulate the test made to compute the orientation of the top plate depending on the orientation of the Kassow arm.


All the code have been made completely parametric, it is possible to play with the parameters to create any wanted simulation.
